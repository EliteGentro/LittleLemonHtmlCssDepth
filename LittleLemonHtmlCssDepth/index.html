                    <h2>Our Souvlaki's Leaving</h2>

                    <p>
                        Due to the very scarce availability for the ingredients of a proper greek souvlaki, we are very sad to announce that our very famous dish is leaving our menu temporarily. On April 15, the souvlaki will be discontinued.
